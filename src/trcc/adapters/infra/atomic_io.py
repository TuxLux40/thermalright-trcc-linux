"""Atomic JSON file write — crash-safe, race-safe persistence.

mkstemp + os.replace so concurrent writers and process deaths can
never leave a half-written or interleaved file on disk. os.replace
is atomic on POSIX (rename(2)) and Windows (MoveFileExW with
MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING).

Pattern adapted from JoshWrites's PR #112 — extracted into a single
helper so every JSON writer in the project gets concurrency / crash
safety without each call site reimplementing the dance.
