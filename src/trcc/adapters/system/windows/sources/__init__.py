"""Windows sensor sources — strategy-chain registry.

Importing this package side-effects every concrete source into
``WindowsSensorSource._registry`` **on Windows only**.  On Linux / macOS /
BSD only the ABC is exposed; the concrete sources stay unloaded because
they'd be dormant anyway (``probe()`` short-circuits on non-Windows).

This keeps the OS boundary clean: Windows-only code lives in Windows
territory; the app DI-receives whichever ``Platform`` matches the host
and the rest never touches the import graph.  Tests on Linux can still
``import HWiNFOSource from trcc.adapters.system.windows.sources.hwinfo``
directly (module path), which registers it ad-hoc for that process.

Adding a new source = one new module + one ``@WindowsSensorSource.register('key')``
decorator + one import line below.  Zero touchpoints in the enumerator.
