"""WindowsSensorSource — strategy-chain ABC for Windows sensor data sources.

Mirrors ``PlatformFactory`` / ``ProtocolFactory`` / ``DeviceFactory`` exactly:

    @WindowsSensorSource.register('hwinfo')
    class HWiNFOSource(WindowsSensorSource):
        priority = 10
        ...

The enumerator walks the registry in priority order and asks each source
``probe()``. Live sources ``contribute()`` their sensors. Adding a new
source is one new file with one decorator — zero touchpoints in the
enumerator or platform code.

Why a chain (and not just LHM):
- LHM bundles WinRing0, which Microsoft is increasingly flagging
  (see Neowin / Aqua-Computer threads). Single source of failure.
- HWiNFO64 (when the user has it) has its own signed driver and is the
  faster, more accurate source — but we can't redistribute it.
- ``MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature`` is always available, works on a
  fraction of hardware, but never gets banned.

Layered priorities, fail-soft. We never have *nothing*.

Layer: adapter (Windows-specific). Allowed to import from sibling Windows
helpers (``_windows_wmi``) and core; never from other OS adapters.

    Subclass contract — three class attributes + two abstract methods:

    Attributes
    ----------
    priority : int
        Lower = tried first.  Reserve ranges so insertions don't reshuffle:
        ``10`` HWiNFO64, ``20`` LibreHardwareMonitor, ``30`` MSAcpi WMI.
    name : str
        Display name for logs ("HWiNFO64", "LibreHardwareMonitor", "MSAcpi").
    provides_gpu : bool
        Whether this source registers GPU temperature/usage sensors.  Used by
        the enumerator so the base pynvml fallback can skip when a higher-
        priority source already covered NVIDIA.

    Methods
    -------
    probe() -> bool
        Fast, non-destructive availability check.  No side effects on False;
        cheap setup (handle caching) on True is fine.
    contribute(enum) -> None
        Register ``SensorInfo`` entries on ``enum._sensors`` and bind a poll
        callback by overriding ``poll(enum, readings)`` — the enumerator
        invokes it each tick.
    stop() -> None
        Optional cleanup (close handles, terminate spawned subprocesses).
        Default no-op.
