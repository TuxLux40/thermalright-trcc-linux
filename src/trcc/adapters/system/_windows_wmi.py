"""WMI handle factory — single sanctioned ``wmi.WMI()`` call site.

``wmi.WMI()`` requires ``pythoncom.CoInitialize`` to have been called for the
*current thread* before the WMI object is constructed.  Every USB-detect
or sensor-poll path that reaches WMI from a worker thread (Qt event loop,
background poller, daemon-mode RPC) without that init raises
``wmi.x_wmi_uninitialised_thread`` — the symptom reporter
`lallemandgianni-boop` filed as #131.

Centralizing here means the COM-init discipline lives in one place; all
other Windows-specific modules ``from ._windows_wmi import wmi_handle`` and
never construct ``wmi.WMI()`` directly.  ``dev/smoke_anything.py`` enforces
this with the ``windows.wmi.coinit`` probe.

    Calling ``CoInitialize`` is idempotent in practice — the second call in
    the same thread returns ``S_FALSE`` which pythoncom raises as
    ``com_error``; we swallow that branch and proceed.

    ``wmi_kwargs`` are forwarded to ``wmi.WMI`` (e.g. ``namespace='root\\WMI'``).
