"""TRCC composition root — canonical Trcc factory.

One module, one function, used uniformly by CLI / API / GUI / daemon.
Every UI calls :func:`trcc` to obtain its per-process Trcc handle and
gets the same answer based on environment + state. Honors
``TRCC_DAEMON`` to switch between in-process and daemon-proxy modes.

Pure DI (Mark Seemann): all wiring happens here. Trcc takes its
dependencies through the constructor; nothing mutates a built Trcc
later. Cosmic Python's bootstrap function shape — defaults make
production easy, kwargs let tests inject fakes.

Composition pattern (the only one in this codebase)::

    from trcc._boot import trcc
    result = trcc().lcd.set_brightness(0, 50)
    typer.echo(result.format())          # CLI
    return _to_response(result)          # API
    self._status_label.setText(...)      # GUI

Modes:

  ``TRCC_DAEMON`` unset (default)
      Builds the in-process `Trcc` once — single instance per process,
      cached. Construction wires platform, renderer, system service,
      data extraction callable, and theme download callables; then
      runs ``Trcc.discover()`` so the first command sees devices.

  ``TRCC_DAEMON=1`` (and AF_UNIX available)
      Returns a `TrccProxy` connected to a running daemon, auto-spawning
      one via :func:`trcc.daemon.ensure_daemon` if necessary. The proxy
      is a structural drop-in for `Trcc` — call sites are statically
      typed against the same surface either way.

  Windows < build 17063
      ``AF_UNIX`` is unavailable; daemon mode silently falls back to
      in-process. The flag is safe to set on any OS.

Dependency overrides (tests + GUI)::

    from trcc._boot import trcc
    from tests.mock_platform import MockPlatform
    from trcc.adapters.render.qt import QtRenderer

    # Tests: pass a MockPlatform to skip real USB.
    trcc(MockPlatform(specs))

    # GUI: pass its own windowed renderer + defer discover until splash.
    trcc(platform, renderer=QtRenderer(), discover_now=False)
