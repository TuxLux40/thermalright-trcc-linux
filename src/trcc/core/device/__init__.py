"""Device package — LCD and LED device facades.

Concrete classes live in their submodules; import them directly:

    from trcc.core.device.lcd import LCDDevice
    from trcc.core.device.led import LEDDevice

``Device`` is the shared ABC both classes implement — use it for
collections (`list[Device]`) and for parameters that accept either.
