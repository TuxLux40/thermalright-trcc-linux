"""Daemon-control endpoints under ``/trcc/``.

The existing ``/system`` and ``/devices`` namespaces are device- and
metrics-shaped; daemon-control is conceptually different (lifecycle of
the singleton process itself), so it lives under its own prefix.

Endpoints:

  POST /trcc/kill    — stop the running daemon
  GET  /trcc/status  — daemon pid / uptime / device counts; ``running``
                       is False when no daemon is up.
