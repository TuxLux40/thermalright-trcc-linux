"""BaseHandler — shared interface for device handlers.

Holds a ``Device`` (the ABC) and routes the mutual lifecycle methods
through it. LCD and LED handlers inherit from this; they keep a typed
reference to their concrete subclass for the type-specific calls
(``send_image``, ``update_color``, zone-*, etc.) that aren't on the ABC.

This is the UI side of the chain:
    ``UI handler → device.{connect, cleanup, update_metrics, tick} → protocol``
